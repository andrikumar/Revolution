### Can you make AI fairer than a judge?
This article serves as the perfect example of how AI is not completely detached from humans. The AI in question, COMPAS, provides judges a score on a particular individual on how likely they are to commit a crime. The article brings up the obvious questions: so what is that score? As the article points out deciding the right score is difficult because different demographics are needlessly jailed at different rates.  As a result, the burden of responsibility returns back to us. Now it is up to the humans to decide whether to use one score for everyone (knowing it will result in biased decisions) or use different scores for people based off race (which also becomes unfair). Once again the age old statement comes into play: Garbage in, garbage out. Essentially, COMPAS was trained on data that ultimately was not perfect. There are so many factors that go into the reason someone is rearrested and it is impossible for a dataset to accurately capture them all. Thus, with “garbage data” put into the AI, the AI produces “garbage” answers since the problem at hand still remains. 

### Google
Reading this paper felt a bit like I had entered a time machine and went back to 1998. The paper’s tone in regarding to technology was genuinely so pure and optimistic. This was especially interesting to see after Karen’s talk and how she explained that many of times engineers do not even realize the problematic potential their technology can have. As I read, it became clear that Brin and Page similarly had the most genuine intent and were just trying to solve an information access problem. They saw users having trouble on the internet and thought they could use their PageRank system to create a powerful solution. They did not think about what it means to decide which pages are more valuable than other in a social scale. Brin and Page chose to determine value based on the amount of times a page is referenced. However, clearly only content creators with a great deal of power would have their works referenced numerous times. Creators that are new and less networked would not have this opportunity. This obviously meant rich, white creators and organizations of those people, were always shown first and considered more valuable. I wonder how society would be different if Brin and Page let websites that were just “Bill Clinton Joke of the Day” be shown first. Or if they just simplified their idea and just show academic resources first? They did talk a great deal about the increase in “.coms”—what if they showed those last?  

### Ferguson is the Future
“Ferguson is the Future” serves as the perfect compliment to the “Pitfalls of Liberalism” and maybe even Communist Manifesto.  Simply, the oppressor cannot genuinely assist the oppressed. When I first began reading the story, if I am honest, I was a little confused on why Ruha Benjamin had created a world in which victims of police brutality could be brought back to life through transplants through the Reparations Initiative. It seemed like a ill-fitting band aid on what is clearly a gaping wound. However, the ending, in which she reveals that the initiative was only created to test out the technology and it will later be given to only the elite class. Once again the oppressed are using like objects for the benefits of the oppressor, which the entire time had claimed to have the oppressed interests in mind. Returning back to the prologue of this paper, I think this speculative work answers Benjamin’s original question on how can we imagine hearts growing in labs but not empathy? The answer, as her fictional story explains, is that hearts benefit the oppressor, not empathy. We can only imagine what the oppressor lets us. 

### Research
Last semester, I did a project in which I had a facial recognition algorithm watch me for an entire week so I can explore what it means to be gazed upon. For this assignment, I decided to revisit facial recognition technology to see what was going on currently. I discovered that there are three main topics right now in the field: Clearview AI, the United States Government, and the data that goes into facial recognition technologies. Essentially, Clearview AI is a company that is creating a powerful facial recognition tool and working in collaboration with the United States government to increase the government’s surveillance abilities. In recent new, the large technology companies have gone public and criticized Clearview AI for working with the government and unethically using photos of people from Facebook/other sites to build their AI. The argument is that these photos are taken without consent, but Clearview argues it is under their First Amendment right. As I read articles on the topic, I kept feeling like rolling my eyes. Many of these companies that are criticizing Clearview, practice similar data collection processes and their public statements feel extremely hypocritical. Yet, after my feelings of being annoyed had faded, I started to question why I had not seen any articles on the unethical practices of the other large corporations while researching facial recognition. I know for a fact Google has a facial recognition AI (I had used in my last project), so where were any of the dissenting articles? This just makes me question the intent of these whistleblower articles on Clearview and become curious about what I am not being told in the news. 




## Jan 27th HW
### Thoughts on the Planetary: An Interview with Achilles Mbembe
Mbembe’s arguments was really refreshing as it actually looked into the relationship people have with technology. Many philosophers/thinkers will kind of assume that humans could live without technology and discuss technology through the lens that it is this separate entity. Before this program, I similarly thought that while technology is bad. I mean, we could always just turn off our laptops, right? Yet, Mbembe makes it clear that turning off our screens will not do anything now. Not only do we have a symbiotic relationship but humans have completely changed because of technology’s presence.

He explains that technology  “deeply changes the ways in which cognitive process unfold, how people dream, and what kind of change they dream about…”. Human behavior is just fundamentally different now. While I was really drawn to this argument because it perhaps one of the most honest looks on technology, this statement makes me wonder how we should discuss technology critically. Typically in a discussion, we use historical references. However, if humans no longer act or think the same, can we use those references? For instance, if humans are no longer think the same as they use to, then let’s say we are “Humans Version 2.” So how can we use the way people thought in “Humans Version One” for reference? 

### The Pitfalls of Liberalism
The arguments in the reading are the ones that have always been on the tip of my tongue but I just never knew how to convey them. Carmichael’s discussion on violence truly encapsulates how resistance is viewed and treated, especially in America. Our history is one that is violent and where dissent was seen as patriotic; however, as Carmichael explains, it is impossible for the oppressed minority to maintain these traits. 

The other day I was thinking about how the words “pioneer”, “trailblazer”, and “voyager” are positive words, celebrating someone accomplishing something new, but are smeared with such violent historical origins (specifically where white men were violent to poc). It once again shows that violence is not considered a bad thing when the ball is the oppressor’s court.

As I read this article, I found myself thinking about an experience I had at my previous school, in which a clearly white supremacist was coming to speak and students protested. The protest was not violent and no one got hurt, but it was aggressive. However, the school expelled the students (those predominately from minority backgrounds) for not upholding the school’s ethics on behavior. This experience perfectly embodies Carmichael’s thesis in this paper.

### Radical Foundation of Indian Technoscience
The relationship of technology and Indians was one I have been aware of since I was young and have seen transform over the last two decades. For instance, my parent’s hometown is a little town called Kota that is in the outskirts of Rajasthan. However, over the years, Kota has changed from a small town to the center of engineering tutoring. In India, it is common for a child to go to tutoring centers, but unlike in America, it is not so they can catch up on material in the classroom. Instead, tutoring centers teach students how to excel at exams so they can get into top colleges. 

The Allen Institute along with other famous engineering tutoring centers are based in Kota and they are the best in the entire country. They not only sell the dream of getting a child into a top engineering school, like IIT (which is mentioned in the reading!) but have repeatedly succeeded. Children from all over India travel thousands of miles to attend these centers in what was typically known as just another small town. 

I wanted to share this story because it shows how I was raised to see technology as an Indian. Technology is a thing of great social and economic power. Parents are willingly sending their kids thousands of miles away for months at a time so their kids can perhaps get a small chance to enter technology, leave Indian, and achieve the American Dream (or Canadian/anywhere else western).

What I was surprised to discover in the reading was that technology was once seen as a tool of political power in India. While I understand the reasons technology was ultimately unable to stay a political tool, I have to admit I am a bit sad. 

Before I read this article, I was always proud at how Indians found a tool like technology to mobilize their community to achieve success post-British power, however, this reading left me sad. What was once a tool to take power back, almost just feeds power back. I say that only because I do not see Indians in technology as people creating their own dreams, but instead as the people who are bringing to life the dreams of what is typically white cis-men. I guess this article has just really enlightened me that we need to start thinking about technology different. We have to stop thinking there is one way to approach this field because we are missing out on opportunities and just repeating past failings. I am planning on reaching out to people I know who are at the Allen Institute and ask if they are aware of the political history. I am curious if academics at these centers are working to rework how technology is approached.

### Mandalas or Raised Fists
This reading served as the perfect deep dive on our lecture from Monday, exploring a bit more into the relationship of Hippies and the Black Panther. I really appreciated how the reading took the time to discuss how privilege played a role between the two group since it was something I was really curious about after class. For example, the discussion on land-banking really examined how privilege, specifically white privilege, resulted in major differences in how the two groups were able to protest. As the reading explained, the Black Panther had to enter “he real estate market, [buy] land by direct purchase or often with borrowed money” in order to gain land. However, the hippies had the privilege of being able to just go and seize a park. I wonder if these differences due to privilege caused any tension between the groups? It also makes me wonder about how POC hippies felt at this time?

### Research
Outside of school, I have done a great deal of work on womxn’s rights, sexual health education, and advocating for the rights of survivors of sexual assault on college campuses. I decided to explore a bit more about what activists for survivors were doing in India for my research this week. While my parents are Indian, I want to acknowledge that I have never lived there or have a deep understanding of the country. For this assignment, I decided to simply do a Google Search and I found that it is become growingly clear that sexual assault is a huge issue in India. As of last year, there were over 30,000 reported cases and of course, most cases go unreported. What is on the mind of people is how violent these rapes have been, how many of targeted children, and how the criminal justice system is extremely flawed (not taking cases seriously, blaming victims, and not working fast enough). There are over 100,000 pending cases. The system is trying to make change happen, for instance the attackers in the Nirbhaya case have been charged with the death penalty which is the first time the death penalty has been charged in 15 years in India. Yet, this clearly is not change enough and  of course, activists are stepping up. One protest that I was really inspired by was the Dignity March in 2019. 5,000 women walked 10,000 km though 24 states in 65 days in order to humanize the movement and increase public dialogue on sexual violence. In a culture in which people are shamed for speaking up, this was an insanely powerful symbol. Unfortunately, these women were met with a great deal of violence from people during this march. However, their perseverance how serious this issue is and hopefully inspired people to enact change.
